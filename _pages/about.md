I received a Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2020 at Purdue University. I worked with my advisor [Prof. David Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd) at [Purdue/DHS Visual Analytics Center of Excellence](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/). My primary research interests lie in visual analytics, information visualization, human-computer interaction, and applied artificial intelligence and machine learning. My recent reserach work focuses on designing visual analytics systems to assist domain experts to handle real world problems. Previously, I received a master degree in Computer Science in 2013 from Tufts University. During my master study, I worked with [Prof. Remco Chang](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) to understand the searching behavior based on interaction event logs.
